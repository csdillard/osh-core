/**
 * <p>
 * There is one procedure registry per sensor hub that is used to keep the list
 * and state of all procedures registered on this hub. (i.e. sensors, actuators,
 * processes, other data sources). The registry generates events when procedures
 * are added and removed from the registry. Implementations backed by a
 * persistent store can be used to persist procedures' state across restarts.
 * </p><p>
 * <i>Note that implementations of this interface may not expose the driver/module
 * objects directly. They usually keep a shadow object reflecting the state of
 * the procedure instead; thus clients of this interface should not rely on
 * specific functionality of the module itself (e.g. sensor driver).</i>
